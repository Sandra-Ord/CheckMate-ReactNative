## Create the App

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app):
```bash
npx create-expo-app@latest projectName -t default
```

### Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:
```bash
npm run reset-project
```
Alternatively:
```bash
node scripts/reset-project.js
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

Alternatively, you can also delete the contents on the **app**, **components** and **hooks** folders.

## Add NativeWind To Your Project

NativeWind allows you to use Tailwind CSS to style your components in React Native.  
Source for adding [NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev/getting-started/react-native).

1. **Install NativeWind and Required Dependencies**  
    ```bash
    npx expo install nativewind tailwindcss react-native-reanimated react-native-safe-area-context
    ```
   
2. **Tailwind CSS Configuration**  
   * Initialize `tailwind.config.js` file by running:
     ```bash
     npx tailwindcss init
     ```
   * Update the configuration by replacing the contents of `tailwind.config.js` file with the following code:
     ```js
     /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
     module.exports = {
       // NOTE: Update this to include the paths to all of your component files (that will use TailWind CSS).
       content: ["./app/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
       presets: [require("nativewind/preset")],
       theme: {
         extend: {},
       },
       plugins: [],
     }
     ```
     
3. **Create a `global.css` file**  
    In the root of your project, create a `global.css` file with the following content to include TailWind's base, components and utilities styles: 
    ```css
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;
    ```
   
4. **Update the Babel Configuration**  
   Replace the content of `babel.config.js` with this configuration to enable NativeWind with Babel:
    ```js
    module.exports = function (api) {
      api.cache(true);
      return {
        presets: [
          ["babel-preset-expo", { jsxImportSource: "nativewind" }],
          "nativewind/babel",
        ],
      };
    };
    ```
   
5. **Configure Metro with NativeWind**  
   In the project root, create or update `metro.config.js` file with the following setup:
    ```js
    const { getDefaultConfig } = require("expo/metro-config");
    const { withNativeWind } = require('nativewind/metro');
    
    const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname)
    
    module.exports = withNativeWind(config, { input: './global.css' })
    ```

6. **Import the `global.css` File in the App's Entry Point**  
   In your app's entry file (such as `App.js or `index.js), add the following import:
    ```ts
    import "./global.css"
    ```
   
7. **Update `app.json` for Metro Bundler on Web**  
   To use Metro as the bundler for web, update your `app.json` with the following configuration:
    ```json
    {
      "expo": {
        "web": {
          "bundler": "metro"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

8. **Add Type Declarations for NativeWind**  
   In the root of your project, create an `app.d.ts` file with this content to include type declarations for NativeWind:
    ```ts
    /// <reference types="nativewind/types" />
    ```

## Running the project

### Start the Development Server

```bash
npx expo start
```

Starts the Expo development server and opens the Expo Developer Tools interface in your default web browser. 
You can scan the QR code with the Expo Go app to preview the app on a physical device without 
building a standalone app.

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

Alternatively:
```bash
npm start
```

Runs the default start script defined in the package.json file, which will internally run npx expo start in Expo projects.
For projects created with Expo, will internally run `npx expo start`.


### Generating Native Project Files

```bash
npx expo prebuild
```

Generates native Android and iOS project files, creating android and ios directories in your Expo project. 
This is required if you need to add custom native code or libraries, as it converts the project from a 
managed workflow to a bare workflow.


### Building and Running the App Directly on Devices or Emulators

> **Note**:   
> 
> Before running the following commands, 
> ensure youâ€™ve run `npx expo prebuild` to generate native files. 
> 
> The `npx expo run:ios` command requires macOS with Xcode installed for iOS builds.


### Android 

```bash
npx expo run:android
```

Builds and runs the app on an Android device or emulator. 
This compiles your app into a native Android package (APK or AAB), 
which can run directly on an Android device or emulator without needing the Expo Go app. 
Ideal for testing Android-specific features and native modules.


### iOS

```bash
npx expo run:ios
```

Builds and runs the app on an iOS device or simulator. 
This compiles your app into a native iOS package, 
allowing you to run it directly on an iOS device or simulator. 
Useful for testing iOS-specific features or integrations that are not supported by the Expo Go app.

    ```
2. Start the app

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
